    "description": "So recently my neighbour has installed a cctv camera on top of his garage that is able to swivel/turn to look into my bedroom. For context I'm a 17yo female. I know this as my mum went to chap his door and ask him about the camera placement and he admitted the camera is able to look into my bedroom but he says quote 'He isn't going to do that'. This specific man has a previous record of dv or some form of domestic abuse against his ex wife/girlfriend that happened late 2024, and obviously isn't known to be the kindest to women as I heard it all through my bedroom wall. I also have other things I heard once summer out the garden as he had a conversation with his friends/family where he admitted that men have a primal attraction to younger women and called himself a 'Hunter Gatherer'. Which I think says it all, I have a photo of the camera's position but I'm unable to attach on this thread here but if anyone wants it for reference I'm happy to send it for a second opinion."

    "title": "WAKE UP: Sheriff Robert Norris Is a Warning of America's Descent into Fascism",
    "description": "Sheriff Robert Norris didn't just assault a citizen at a public meeting—he showed America exactly what the future looks like if we don't fight back against the fascist takeover happening right now. This isn't just about one sheriff abusing his power. It's about the rise of authoritarian enforcers who believe they are above the law—a movement fueled by Trumpism, white nationalism, and the complete dismantling of democracy. THE FASCIST PLAYBOOK IS ALREADY IN MOTION Watch the video. This man felt completely comfortable violently grabbing a citizen, threatening her with pepper spray, and trying to drag her out of a public meeting—all while wearing his badge. He didn't hide it. He didn't try to justify it. Because he doesn't think he has to. And why would he? This is exactly how authoritarian regimes start—with small-time power-hungry enforcers testing the limits of what they can get away with. - Banning books: Norris illegally removed books from a public library, deciding he gets to control what people can and cannot read. - Silencing critics: He is being sued for publicly smearing a woman with false accusations—an intimidation tactic straight from the dictator's playbook. - Aligning with extremists: He's been spotted at GOP rallies with known white nationalists and far-right extremists. THIS ISN'T A FLUKE. THIS IS A PLAN. TRUMPISM IS TRAINING THESE PEOPLE TO BE HIS FOOT SOLDIERS For years, Trump and his fascist allies have been corrupting law enforcement, the courts, and local governments, planting people like Norris in positions of power so they can act as MAGA enforcers when the time comes. They want sheriffs who ignore the Constitution and police who see political enemies, not citizens. They want judges, mayors, and lawmakers who will punish dissenters and protect their own. This is how it starts. A sheriff gets away with attacking a citizen. Then another bans books. Then another refuses to enforce federal law. Then, suddenly, the law doesn't apply anymore—unless you're on their side. THIS IS THE POINT OF NO RETURN—WHAT WILL YOU DO? The worst part of the Norris video? Nobody stopped him. The people in that room sat there and watched a public official assault someone—just like people watched Trump attack democracy, dismantle institutions, and get away with everything. If we keep letting them do this, it will never stop. We are on the edge. If we let this continue, this will be our new reality: - Protesters and critics silenced by force - The Constitution ignored at will - Elections manipulated - Law enforcement turned into a personal militia We have two choices: EXPOSE THEM AND FIGHT BACK, OR LOSE EVERYTHING. - Call these people out—LOUDLY. Share their names. Show the proof. - Vote them out—before voting no longer matters. - Support lawsuits, investigations, and whistleblowers who are trying to stop them. Sheriff Robert Norris is not a fluke. He is the future if we don't act. This is our warning. And if we ignore it, we will regret it for the rest of our lives."
